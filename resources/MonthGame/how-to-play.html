    <h1>Controls</h1>
    <h2>Motion</h2>
    Hold down the left mouse button to move your tank towards the pointer. Release to stop. The blue circle depicts your maximum range for this turn and when it shrinks to nothing, your tank stops.
    <h2>Firing</h2>
    Hold down the right mouse button to charge your tanks weapons and release the mouse button to fire. The tank will fire in whatever dirction its currently facing. The red circle (not always visible) depicts the maximum firing range. You cannot charge your weapons to fire beyond this range and the more you charge the more you reduce the maximum firing range for your next shot.
    <h2>Weapons Selection</h2>
    Select your weapons from the drop-down box at the bottom left of the screen. The standard loadout includes rockets and mortars.
    <h3>Rockets</h3>
    Rockets pack quite a bit of damage but don't fly very high so they'll crash into any barriers between you and your target. Try multi-rockets for a serious blow.
    <h3>Mortars</h3>
    Mortars are cheap and essentially unlimited but their range isn't as good as rockets and they don't deliver quite as much damage. However, mortars fly high enough to clear any defensive barriers.
